```bash
django-admin startproject Health .
```

7. Created a Django app named patients:
```bash
python manage.py startapp patients
```

8. Applied initial database migrations:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

10. Created view functions in patients/views.py

11. Created URL patterns in patients/urls.py

12. Included patients URLs in the main projectâ€™s urls.py

13. Created an Images folder and added image files

#####  Why use Django URLS
- To manage different paths
- If we are describing any python apps inside the django, then 
we have to use urls.py where we have to define the paths for different apps 
which is written in views.py

##### manage.py
- manages overall project
- has main function
- makemigrations

##### settings.py
- all configurations happen here

##### wsgi.py
- to host project
