* Why use Django URLS
- To manage different paths
- If we are describing any python apps inside the django, then 
we have to use urls.py where we have to define the paths for different apps 
which is written in views.py

* manage.py
- manages overall project
- has main function
- makemigrations

* settings.py
- all configurations happen here

* wsgi.py
- to host project
